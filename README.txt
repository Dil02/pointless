WELCOME TO POINTLESS! - 29th November 2020
 
Pointless is the first Java project I developed during the first semester of my degree.
It resembles the popular BBC game show in which a contestant is awarded points based on the
most correct unique answer. The aim is to choose an answer that is correct but is the 
least popular response. To win the game you need to gain as few points as possible.

This project involved:

* Arrays
* Abstract Data Types
* File I/O
* Sorting

To get it working:

Simply download this repository which contains the main Pointless class, the abstract data
type classes as well as the '.csv' files which include the questions. Lastly, compile and 
enjoy!
